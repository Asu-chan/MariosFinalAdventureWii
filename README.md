# Mario's Final Adventure Wii
## Public Resources Release

### Information 

This repo includes some of the resources used to make the [**Mario's Final Adventure Wii**](https://gamebanana.com/wips/65286) game mod, which is a mod of **New Super Mario Bros. Wii** based on [**Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii**](https://newerteam.com/wii/).

These resources include:
- The game's source code
- The game's WorldInfo.bin editor tool
- The game's worldmaps [**Koopatlas**](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW/tree/clang-no-translations/Koopatlas) project files
- The game's worldmap tilesets 

This repo is (meant to be) a fork of the [/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW, clang-no-translations branch](https://github.com/Newer-Team/NewerSMBW/tree/clang-no-translations) repo since most of [**Newer Super Mario Bros. Wii**](https://newerteam.com/wii/)'s code was used in [**Mario's Final Adventure Wii**](https://gamebanana.com/wips/65286).

Unfortunately, GitHub doesn't allow to fork the same repo more than once so this repo isn't marked as a fork.

### Licensing
