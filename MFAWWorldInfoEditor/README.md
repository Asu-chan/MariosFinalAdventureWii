# Mario's Final Adventure Wii
## MFAW World Info Editor

### Information 

This folder includes the source code and a build of the **MFAW World Info Editor** tool, that allows to edit the `WorldInfo.bin` file contained in [**Mario's Final Adventure Wii**](https://gamebanana.com/wips/65286)'s `NewerRes` folder.

This file contains color information and properties about each worlds, as well as the items that each world's shop contains. It is required for the [World Selector](https://github.com/Asu-chan/MariosFinalAdventureWii/blob/clang-no-translations/Kamek/src/koopatlas/worldselector.cpp) to work properly.

### Building

You can build the **MFAW World Info Editor** using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Only the 2019 version was tested, though you shouldn't have any trouble building it with version 2022.

### Credits

This tool was programmed entirely by [Asu-chan](https://github.com/Asu-chan) (me).
